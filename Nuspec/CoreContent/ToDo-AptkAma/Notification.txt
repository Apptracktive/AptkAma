//// Setup ////

1. (Optional) If you plan to use notifications, you can handle its life cycle by implementing the AptkAmaBaseNotificationHandler class like:

    public class AptkAmaNotificationHandler : AptkAmaBaseNotificationHandler
    {
        public static IAptkAmaNotificationTemplate TestNotificationTemplate = new AptkAmaNotificationTemplate("MyTemplate")
        {
            {"name", "$(name)"},
            {"alert", "$(message)"},
            {"sound", "default"}
        };

        public AptkAmaNotificationHandler()
        {
            GoogleSenderIds = Constants.GoogleSenderIds;
        }

        public override void OnNotificationReceived(IAptkAmaNotification notification)
        {
            if (notification.IsTypeOf(TestNotificationTemplate))
            {
            }
        }
    }

where TestNotificationTemplate is an example of a notification custom template.


//// Usage ////

The main purpose is to access any API functionality by a single line of code from anywhere in the project (PCL or not), like:

	await _aptkAmaService.Notification.RegisterAsync(AptkAmaNotificationHandler.TestNotificationTemplate);

or:
	
	await _aptkAmaService.Notification.UnregisterAsync();

where _aptkAmaService is resolved from AptkAmaPluginLoader.Instance.

On the handler side, the OnNotificationReceived method will be called as soon as a notification (you registered for) comes in.
From here, you can check the type of the incoming notification thanks to the IsTypeOf method with any template you registered for.
You could then for example ask for a local notification thanks to the LocalNotification plugin for Xamarin & Windows.
