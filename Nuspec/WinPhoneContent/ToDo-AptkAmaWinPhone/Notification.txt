Notification does not seem to be supported by Azure Mobile Apps with Windows Phone Silverlight.
That's why it is not implemented in AptkAma.
Please consider to upgrade your application to WinRT or UWP.
If you want to stay at a Windows Phone Silverlight level, you should replace AptkAma by AptkAms nuget plugin 
wich use the fully compatible Azure Mobile Services.
