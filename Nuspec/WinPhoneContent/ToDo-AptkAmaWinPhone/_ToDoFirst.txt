//// Setup ////

1. Add these lines right after RootFrame.NavigationFailed += RootFrame_NavigationFailed into the App InitializePhoneApplication method and complete it:

        var configuration = new AptkAmaPluginConfiguration("YOUR URL", typeof("ONE OF YOUR MODEL CLASS").GetTypeInfo().Assembly);
        AptkAmaPluginLoader.Init(configuration);

If you use it with Xamarin.Forms, be sure to paste it just before LoadApplication(...)

2. (Optional) Registering an intance of this plugin with IoC is a better way to use it than calling the static AptkAmaPluginLoader.Instance each time.
Please look at MvvmCross, MvvmLight, FreshMvvm or any Mvvm/IoC framework of your choice and see online documentation and tutorials

3. (Optional) If you implemented the IAptkAmaCacheService interface for local caching purpose, 
add this line BEFORE AptkAmaPluginLoader.Init(configuration); :

	configuration.CacheService = new AptkAmaCacheService();

where AptkAmaCacheService is the name of your implementatation class.


//// Usage ////

See the ToDo-AptkAma's _ToDoFirst

Enjoy!


/!\ 1: If you want to manage local data thanks to LocalTable<T> and other methods
you have to install the AptkAma Plugin LocalStore Extension nuget package
